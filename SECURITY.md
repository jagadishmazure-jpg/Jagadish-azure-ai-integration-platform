# Security policy

## Supported versions

Only the `main` branch is maintained. There are no released versions.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue with the details.

1. Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting: **Security** tab -> **Report a vulnerability** on [Jagadish-azure-ai-integration-platform](https://github.com/jagadishmazure-jpg/Jagadish-azure-ai-integration-platform/security).
2. If that button is not shown, open an issue titled `Security contact request` with no technical details, and I will reply with a private channel.

I aim to acknowledge a report within 5 working days. This is a personal portfolio maintained by one person, so there is no formal SLA or bug bounty.

## Scope

This repository is a demonstration. It runs offline against mocks and synthetic data and has never been deployed to a live Azure tenant. The SaaS systems are sandbox stand-ins. In scope: anything in the code, infrastructure definitions or workflows that would be unsafe if someone deployed it as written (for example, a role that is broader than documented, a secret that could leak through CI, or a guardrail that can be bypassed). Out of scope: the deterministic mocks and sandbox stand-ins themselves.

## What the repo already does

- No secrets in the repo; a hygiene test fails CI on secret-like values ([`tests/test_repo_hygiene.py`](tests/test_repo_hygiene.py)).
- CI signs in to Azure with OIDC only ([ADR 0003](docs/adr/0003-oidc-and-managed-identity.md)).
- OBO so agents act with the user's permissions; one managed identity per workload with resource-scoped roles.
- Default-deny policy, sandboxed tool code, signed audit chains and an out-of-band monitor with a kill switch ([`src/aiip/safety/`](src/aiip/safety/README.md)).
- checkov scans the Terraform on every change, with each skipped check justified in [`.checkov.yaml`](.checkov.yaml).
- **Supply chain:** every third-party GitHub Action is pinned to a full commit SHA with its version in a comment, and every workflow starts from read-only `permissions`. Dependabot proposes weekly, grouped updates ([`.github/dependabot.yml`](.github/dependabot.yml)); CodeQL scans the Python code and the workflow files ([`codeql.yml`](.github/workflows/codeql.yml)); gitleaks scans the full git history in CI. A test (`test_workflows_are_hardened`) fails if an action is left unpinned or a workflow loses its `permissions` block.
- **SBOM:** the `sbom` job in [`ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) builds an SPDX JSON software bill of materials from the lockfiles and manifests on every run and keeps it as the `sbom.spdx.json` build artifact.
- **Container images:** base images are pinned by digest (the tag stays for readability; Dependabot's docker ecosystem moves both), and pip/uv are removed from the runtime layer. The image job in [`infra.yml`](.github/workflows/infra.yml) then (1) runs Trivy `v0.70.0` through `aquasecurity/trivy-action` v0.36.0, pinned to its commit SHA because older trivy-action tags were hijacked in a public supply-chain incident, and fails on any HIGH or CRITICAL finding that has a fix; (2) writes an SPDX image SBOM artifact; and (3) on pushes to `main` only, signs SLSA build provenance for the saved image archive with `actions/attest-build-provenance` (Sigstore keyless signing through GitHub OIDC; no registry, no Azure). The archive is kept as a build artifact for five days so the provenance can be checked: download `image-aiip.tar` from the run and run `gh attestation verify image-aiip.tar --repo jagadishmazure-jpg/Jagadish-azure-ai-integration-platform`. CI never pushes these images to a registry.
- **Known scanner false positives** are listed by fingerprint in [`.gitleaksignore`](.gitleaksignore), each with the reason (for example a public Azure built-in role ID); none is a credential.
- **GitHub settings:** secret scanning with push protection, Dependabot alerts and security updates, private vulnerability reporting, and a ruleset on `main` that blocks force-pushes and branch deletion and requires the CI checks before a pull request can merge. The maintainer (repository admin) can still push directly to `main`, so for direct pushes the checks run after the push rather than before it.
