# `infra/terraform`: Terraform twin of the Bicep

The same integration plane as [`../main.bicep`](../main.bicep), written for Terraform (`azurerm`): one managed identity per workload (15 workloads plus the Functions host), Log Analytics + App Insights, Key Vault with secret access only for the vendor-calling workloads, ACR with `AcrPull` for every identity, Service Bus queues with receiver roles for the workers, Event Grid topic + subscriptions routed through the topic identity, the Container Apps environment with 13 HTTP apps and 2 KEDA queue workers, Durable Functions on Flex Consumption with identity-only storage, APIM with one API per gateway, and the opt-in Front Door, private networking and AKS profiles. Output names match the Bicep outputs.

## Bicep or Terraform?

Both toolchains describe the same resources, so the choice is about the client, not the design:

| Pick Bicep when | Pick Terraform when |
|---|---|
| The estate is Azure-only and the team already uses `azd`, ARM deployment history and Azure Policy. | The client already runs Terraform (platform team, module registry, Terraform Cloud / Enterprise, Spacelift, Atlantis). |
| You need a new resource API version the day it ships (Bicep types come straight from the ARM specs). | Several clouds or SaaS providers (GitHub, Entra, Datadog) must be managed from one workflow. |
| You want no state file to secure: ARM is the source of truth, `what-if` previews changes. | Reviewers want a `plan` in every pull request and state-based drift detection. |

Trade-offs to state up front:

- **State.** Terraform needs a secured remote state (here: Azure Storage with Entra ID auth, no account keys). Bicep has none to lose or leak, but it also has no drift report beyond `what-if`.
- **New features.** `azurerm` lags new Azure APIs by weeks. The `azapi` provider fills that gap by calling ARM directly with the same API versions Bicep uses; it is used here only where needed.
- **One source of truth per environment.** Pick one tool per environment and stay with it. Both tools can target the same subscription, but they must never manage the same resource group, or each will try to undo the other's changes.

## Differences from the Bicep (on purpose)

| Topic | Bicep | Terraform |
|---|---|---|
| Names | `<abbr>-<uniqueString>` (azd style) | CAF: `rg-aiip-dev-eus2-001`, `id-tool-gateway-aiip-dev-eus2-001`, `kv-aiip-dev-001`, ... |
| Tags | `azd-env-name`, `project` | `env`, `owner`, `project`, `cost-center`, `workload`, `managed-by` |
| Private networking | private-endpoint subnet `10.40.4.0/24` | `10.40.2.0/24`, plus an NSG on both subnets |
| AKS profile | minimal cluster | also: patch upgrade channel, Azure CNI overlay + network policy, Azure RBAC, local accounts off, Key Vault CSI rotation |
| Functions storage | shared keys off | also: local users off, blob + container soft delete |

## Naming, tags and the cost-min profile

- **Names** follow the Cloud Adoption Framework pattern `<type>-<workload>-<env>-<region>-<instance>`, for example `rg-aiip-dev-eus2-001`. Key Vault drops the region (24-character limit); ACR and Storage use the alphanumeric form. Set `name_suffix` when forking so globally unique names don't collide.
- **Tags** on every resource group and resource: `env`, `owner`, `project`, `cost-center`, plus `workload` and `managed-by`. Override `owner` / `cost_center` per client in the tfvars.
- **Profiles.** `envs/dev.tfvars` selects the cost-min profile (scale-to-zero apps, Consumption APIM, Basic Service Bus, Flex Functions, 1 GB/day log cap, no Front Door or private networking). `envs/prod.tfvars` selects the hardened/always-on shape (StandardV2 APIM, warm replicas, private endpoints (Service Bus forced to Premium), Front Door, no log cap, Key Vault purge protection). Check the SKUs against the client's pricing agreement before any apply.

## Remote state (one-time bootstrap)

`backend.tf` is a partial `azurerm` backend. Create the storage once per subscription (or per client landing zone), with shared keys off so only Entra ID principals can read state:

```bash
az group create -n rg-tfstate-shared-eus2-001 -l eastus2 --tags env=shared owner=<you> project=tfstate cost-center=<cc>
az storage account create -n <globally-unique-name> -g rg-tfstate-shared-eus2-001 -l eastus2 \
  --sku Standard_ZRS --min-tls-version TLS1_2 --allow-blob-public-access false --allow-shared-key-access false
az storage container create --account-name <name> -n tfstate --auth-mode login
# the deploying identity needs "Storage Blob Data Contributor" on the container
```

Then pass the names at init (the pipeline reads them from the `TFSTATE_RESOURCE_GROUP` / `TFSTATE_STORAGE_ACCOUNT` variables):

```bash
terraform init -backend-config=envs/dev.backend.hcl \
  -backend-config=resource_group_name=rg-tfstate-shared-eus2-001 -backend-config=storage_account_name=<name>
```

## Validate locally (no Azure needed)

```bash
terraform init -backend=false
terraform fmt -check -recursive
terraform validate
terraform test          # plans with mocked providers and checks names, tags and profile shape
tflint --init && tflint --recursive
checkov -d . --config-file ../../.checkov.yaml
```

**Status:** validated offline only (the commands above run in CI on every pull request). No `apply` has been run: there is no Azure subscription yet.

## Files

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| [`envs/`](envs/README.md) | dev / prod tfvars and partial backend configs. |
| [`modules/`](modules/README.md) | Reusable modules (one per Bicep module). |
| [`tests/`](tests/README.md) | Offline `terraform test` plans with a mocked provider. |
| [`.terraform.lock.hcl`](.terraform.lock.hcl) | Provider lock file (exact versions and checksums) so CI and laptops resolve the same providers. |
| [`.tflint.hcl`](.tflint.hcl) | tflint configuration (terraform recommended preset + azurerm ruleset). |
| [`backend.tf`](backend.tf) | Empty `azurerm` backend block (partial config); coordinates are passed with `-backend-config` at init. |
| [`locals.tf`](locals.tf) | Derived values: cost profile table, effective SKUs, the tag set, workload lists. |
| [`main.tf`](main.tf) | Resources (and module calls for a root stack). |
| [`outputs.tf`](outputs.tf) | Values exported to the caller / the pipeline. |
| [`providers.tf`](providers.tf) | Provider configuration. Credentials come from the environment (`az login` locally, OIDC in Actions); no secrets in code. |
